QUESTION
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2].
Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.



SOLUTION:
class Solution {
    public int[] findMissingAndRepeatedValues(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int[] cnt = new int[n * n + 1];
        int[] ans = new int[2];
        for (int[] row : grid) {
            for (int x : row) {
                if (++cnt[x] == 2) {
                    ans[0] = x;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int x = 1;; ++x) {
            if (cnt[x] == 0) {
                ans[1] = x;
                return ans;
            }
        }
    }
}
